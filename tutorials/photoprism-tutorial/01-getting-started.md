## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker logs
   docker logs photoprism

   # Common issues:
   # - Port 2342 already in use
   # - Insufficient permissions
   # - Invalid volume paths
   ```

2. **Cannot Access Web Interface**
   ```bash
   # Check if service is running
   docker ps | grep photoprism

   # Check port binding
   netstat -tlnp | grep 2342

   # Firewall issues
   sudo ufw allow 2342
   ```

3. **Photos Not Appearing**
   ```bash
   # Check file permissions
   ls -la ~/photoprism/photos/

   # Check container logs for indexing errors
   docker logs photoprism | grep -i error

   # Manual re-index
   docker exec photoprism photoprism index
   ```

4. **Memory Issues**
   ```bash
   # Increase Docker memory limit
   docker run --memory=4g --memory-swap=8g ...

   # Or in docker-compose.yml
   services:
     photoprism:
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             memory: 4G
           reservations:
             memory: 1G
   ```

## 📊 Performance Tuning

### Basic Optimization

```yaml
# Optimized docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  photoprism:
    image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
    environment:
      PHOTOPRISM_WORKERS: 2          # Number of workers
      PHOTOPRISM_INDEX_WORKERS: 1    # Index workers
      PHOTOPRISM_THUMB_FILTER: "lanczos"  # Better quality thumbnails
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4G
        reservations:
          memory: 1G
```
