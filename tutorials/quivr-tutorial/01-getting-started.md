## Your First Document Upload

Let's upload your first document and see Quivr in action:

### Step 1: Access Quivr Interface

```bash
# After installation, access the web interface
open http://localhost:3000

# Or if using Docker
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Knowledge Base

```python
# Using Quivr's Python SDK
from quivr import QuivrClient

# Initialize client
client = QuivrClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Create a knowledge base
kb = client.create_knowledge_base(
    name="My First Knowledge Base",
    description="A collection of documents for testing"
)

print(f"✅ Knowledge base created: {kb.id}")
```

### Step 3: Upload Documents

```python
# Upload a text document
with open("sample-document.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

document = client.upload_document(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    content=content,
    filename="sample-document.txt",
    file_type="text/plain"
)

print(f"📄 Document uploaded: {document.id}")
```

### Step 4: Ask Your First Question

```python
# Ask a question about your document
response = client.ask_question(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    question="What is the main topic of this document?",
    stream=False  # Set to True for streaming responses
)

print("🤖 Answer:", response.answer)
print("📚 Sources:", [source.filename for source in response.sources])
```

    "text": [".txt", ".md", ".rst"],
    "documents": [".pdf", ".docx", ".pptx"],
    "spreadsheets": [".xlsx", ".csv"],
    "images": [".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg"],
    "code": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".java", ".cpp"],
    "web": [".html", ".xml"],
    "archives": [".zip", ".tar.gz"]
}
```

## Working with Different Document Types

### Text Documents

```python
# Upload a text file
text_doc = client.upload_file(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    file_path="article.txt",
    metadata={
        "author": "John Doe",
        "category": "Technology",
        "tags": ["AI", "Machine Learning"]
    }
)
```

### PDF Documents

```python
# Upload a PDF with advanced options
pdf_doc = client.upload_file(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    file_path="research-paper.pdf",
    chunk_size=1000,  # Characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=200,  # Overlap between chunks
    preprocessing={
        "extract_tables": True,
        "extract_images": False,
        "remove_headers": True
    }
)
```

### Web Content

```python
# Upload from URL
web_doc = client.upload_from_url(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    url="https://example.com/article",
    metadata={
        "source": "Web",
        "crawl_depth": 1
    }
)
```

## Basic Query Operations

### Simple Question Answering

```python
# Basic question
response = client.ask(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    question="What are the key benefits of this technology?"
)

print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence}")
```

### Advanced Queries

```python
# Query with filters
response = client.ask(
    knowledge_base_id=kb.id,
    question="Explain the algorithm",
    filters={
        "document_type": "research_paper",
        "author": "Smith",
        "date_range": ["2023-01-01", "2024-01-01"]
    },
    top_k=5  # Return top 5 most relevant results
)
```

### Conversational Queries

```python
# Start a conversation
conversation = client.create_conversation(kb.id)

# Ask follow-up questions
response1 = conversation.ask("What is the main topic?")
response2 = conversation.ask("Can you elaborate on the methodology?")
response3 = conversation.ask("What are the limitations?")

# Get conversation history
history = conversation.get_history()
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Basic Configuration

```python
# Configure Quivr client
client = QuivrClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    timeout=30,
    retries=3
)
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# .env file
QUIVR_API_KEY=your-api-key
QUIVR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-key

# Advanced settings
QUIVR_CHUNK_SIZE=1000
QUIVR_CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
QUIVR_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
QUIVR_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
```

### Model Configuration

```python
# Configure different models
client.configure_models({
    "embedding": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "dimensions": 1536
    },
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "max_tokens": 1000
    }
})
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Basic Monitoring

```python
# Get knowledge base statistics
stats = client.get_knowledge_base_stats(kb.id)

print(f"Documents: {stats.document_count}")
print(f"Total chunks: {stats.total_chunks}")
print(f"Storage used: {stats.storage_mb} MB")
```

### Query Analytics

```python
# Get query history and performance
analytics = client.get_query_analytics(kb.id)

for query in analytics.recent_queries:
    print(f"Query: {query.question}")
    print(f"Response time: {query.response_time}s")
    print(f"Relevance score: {query.relevance_score}")
    print("---")
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Monitor system health
health = client.get_system_health()

print(f"Status: {health.status}")
print(f"Response time: {health.avg_response_time}ms")
print(f"Error rate: {health.error_rate}%")
print(f"Active connections: {health.active_connections}")
```
