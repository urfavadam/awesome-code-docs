# 🗄️ Databases & Storage

> Documentation that explains how data systems store, query, and scale information

## What We're Looking For

Documentation that teaches:
- **Database Internals** - How PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis actually work under the hood  
- **Query Processing** - How databases optimize and execute queries
- **Storage Engines** - B-trees, LSM-trees, and different storage strategies
- **Distributed Systems** - How databases handle replication and scaling
- **Performance Analysis** - Real benchmarks and optimization techniques

## Examples We'd Love to See

- PostgreSQL query planner internals
- Redis memory management and persistence
- MongoDB sharding and consistency  
- SQLite file format deep-dive
- Database comparison with performance benchmarks
