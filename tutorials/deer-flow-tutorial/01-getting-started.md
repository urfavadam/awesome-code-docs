Welcome to Deer Flow! This chapter will guide you through installing and setting up Deer Flow, understanding its core concepts, and creating your first distributed workflow.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Deer Flow installation and setup
- Core concepts (workflows, tasks, dependencies)
- Basic workflow creation and execution
- Web interface and API usage
- First distributed workflow walkthrough

## 🏗️ Deer Flow Architecture

Deer Flow consists of several key components working together to orchestrate distributed workflows:

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Manager**: Orchestrates workflow execution
2. **Task Scheduler**: Assigns tasks to workers
3. **Worker Nodes**: Execute tasks in parallel
4. **State Manager**: Tracks workflow and task states
5. **Result Store**: Persists task outputs and results

## 🚀 Installation Methods

### Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
cd deer-flow

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f deer-flow-server
```

**What this starts:**
- Deer Flow server (port 8080)
- Redis for task queuing
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Web interface

### Method 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv postgresql redis-server

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
cd deer-flow

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup database
sudo -u postgres createdb deerflow
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER deerflow WITH PASSWORD 'deerflow123';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE deerflow TO deerflow;"

# Start Redis
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# Start the server
python run_server.py
```

### Method 3: Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml

## 🏃‍♂️ Your First Workflow

### Creating a Simple Workflow

```json
// simple_workflow.json
{
  "name": "hello_world",
  "description": "A simple hello world workflow",
  "version": "1.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "hello_task",
      "name": "Hello Task",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "echo 'Hello, Deer Flow!'",
      "timeout": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

### Submitting the Workflow

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/workflows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @simple_workflow.json

# Via CLI
deer-flow workflow submit simple_workflow.json

# Via Python SDK
from deerflow import WorkflowClient

client = WorkflowClient("http://localhost:8080")
workflow_id = client.submit_workflow("simple_workflow.json")
print(f"Workflow submitted: {workflow_id}")
```

### Monitoring Execution

```bash
# Check workflow status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflows/{workflow_id}/status

# View task logs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflows/{workflow_id}/tasks/{task_id}/logs

# Get workflow results
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflows/{workflow_id}/result
```

## 📊 Understanding Workflow States

## 📊 Monitoring Workflows

### Web Dashboard

The Deer Flow web interface provides:

- **Workflow Overview**: List of all workflows with status
- **Task Details**: Individual task execution details
- **Real-time Logs**: Live streaming of task logs
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times and success rates
- **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of task relationships

### API Monitoring

```bash
# Get workflow statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflows/stats

# List running workflows
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflows?status=running

# Get task execution history
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/history

# Monitor system health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps

# Verify API connectivity
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Check logs
docker-compose logs deer-flow-server
```

#### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database connectivity
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U deerflow -d deerflow -c "SELECT 1"

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Worker Issues
```bash
# Check worker status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workers

# Restart workers
docker-compose restart deer-flow-worker

# Scale workers
docker-compose up -d --scale deer-flow-worker=3
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Monitor queue length
curl http://localhost:8080/api/queue/stats

# Adjust worker concurrency
export WORKER_CONCURRENCY=8
docker-compose restart deer-flow-worker
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Workflows
- **Definition**: JSON specification of tasks and dependencies
- **Execution**: Orchestrated by the workflow manager
- **State**: Tracked throughout lifecycle
- **Results**: Stored and accessible via API

### Tasks
- **Types**: Shell, HTTP, Python, custom
- **Dependencies**: Define execution order
- **Retries**: Automatic retry on failure
- **Timeouts**: Prevent hanging tasks

### Workers
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for performance
- **Isolation**: Each worker runs in separate container
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics
- **Resource**: CPU and memory allocation

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics to Monitor

```python
# Workflow metrics
workflow_metrics = {
    'total_workflows': 0,
    'running_workflows': 0,
    'completed_workflows': 0,
    'failed_workflows': 0,
    'average_execution_time': 0.0
}

# Task metrics
task_metrics = {
    'total_tasks': 0,
    'running_tasks': 0,
    'completed_tasks': 0,
    'failed_tasks': 0,
    'retry_rate': 0.0
}

# System metrics
system_metrics = {
    'cpu_usage': 0.0,
    'memory_usage': 0.0,
    'queue_length': 0,
    'worker_count': 0
}
```
