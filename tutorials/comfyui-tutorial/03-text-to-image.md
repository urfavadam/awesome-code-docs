# Chapter 3: Text-to-Image Generation

Now that you understand nodes and workflows, let's create stunning images from text prompts! This chapter covers the art and science of text-to-image generation, from basic prompts to advanced techniques.

## Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

### Basic Prompt Structure

```javascript
// Effective prompt components
const promptComponents = {
  subject: "a majestic lion",
  style: "in the style of Salvador Dali",
  quality: "highly detailed, masterpiece",
  lighting: "dramatic lighting, golden hour",
  composition: "centered composition, rule of thirds",
  medium: "oil painting, photorealistic"
};

// Complete prompt example
const examplePrompt = `
A majestic lion standing proudly on a cliff,
in the style of Salvador Dali,
highly detailed masterpiece,
dramatic golden hour lighting,
centered composition,
oil painting, photorealistic,
intricate fur texture, sharp focus
`;
```

### Prompt Weighting Techniques

```javascript
// Weighted prompt syntax
const weightedPrompt = `
(masterpiece:1.2) (best quality:1.1) (highly detailed:1.0)
a beautiful landscape (mountains:1.3) (river:1.2) (forest:1.1)
(dramatic lighting:1.2) (golden hour:1.1)
(oil painting:1.0) (photorealistic:0.9)
--negative
blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, poorly drawn
`;
```

## Model Selection and Configuration

### Popular Models

```javascript
// Model configurations
const modelConfigs = {
  realisticVision: {
    name: "Realistic_Vision_V5.1",
    type: "realistic",
    recommendedSettings: {
      steps: 20,
      cfg: 7.0,
      sampler: "euler",
      scheduler: "normal"
    }
  },

  dreamShaper: {
    name: "DreamShaper_8",
    type: "artistic",
    recommendedSettings: {
      steps: 25,
      cfg: 8.0,
      sampler: "dpmpp_2m",
      scheduler: "karras"
    }
  },

  anythingV5: {
    name: "Anything_V5",
    type: "anime",
    recommendedSettings: {
      steps: 20,
      cfg: 7.0,
      sampler: "euler_a",
      scheduler: "normal"
    }
  }
};
```

### Sampler Selection

```javascript
// Sampler comparison
const samplerComparison = {
  euler: {
    speed: "fast",
    quality: "good",
    useCase: "general purpose"
  },

  dpmpp_2m: {
    speed: "medium",
    quality: "excellent",
    useCase: "high quality"
  },

  dpmpp_2m_karras: {
    speed: "medium",
    quality: "very high",
    useCase: "premium quality"
  },

  lms: {
    speed: "slow",
    quality: "high",
    useCase: "consistent results"
  }
};
```

## Advanced Generation Parameters

### CFG Scale Optimization

```javascript
// CFG scale effects
const cfgScaleGuide = {
  low: {
    range: "1.0-4.0",
    effect: "creative, varied results",
    useCase: "brainstorming, abstract art"
  },

  medium: {
    range: "5.0-8.0",
    effect: "balanced creativity and adherence",
    useCase: "most general use cases"
  },

  high: {
    range: "9.0-15.0",
    effect: "strict prompt following",
    useCase: "precise requirements, product shots"
  },

  veryHigh: {
    range: "16.0+",
    effect: "over-adherence, potential artifacts",
    useCase: "experimental, specific styles"
  }
};
```

### Step Count Optimization

```javascript
// Steps vs quality relationship
const stepOptimization = {
  fast: {
    steps: "10-15",
    quality: "acceptable",
    useCase: "prototyping, quick iterations"
  },

  standard: {
    steps: "20-25",
    quality: "good",
    useCase: "most applications"
  },

  high: {
    steps: "30-40",
    quality: "excellent",
    useCase: "final renders, portfolio work"
  },

  ultra: {
    steps: "50+",
    quality: "diminishing returns",
    useCase: "research, maximum quality"
  }
};
```

## Seed Control and Reproducibility

### Seed Management

```javascript
// Seed control strategies
const seedStrategies = {
  fixed: {
    seed: 12345,
    advantage: "reproducible results",
    useCase: "consistent character designs"
  },

  random: {
    seed: -1,
    advantage: "varied results",
    useCase: "exploration, batch generation"
  },

  incremental: {
    seed: "previous + 1",
    advantage: "controlled variation",
    useCase: "series generation, A/B testing"
  }
};
```

### Batch Generation

```javascript
// Batch processing setup
const batchConfig = {
  emptyLatentImage: {
    batch_size: 4,
    width: 1024,
    height: 1024
  },

 ksampler: {
    seed: 12345,
    steps: 20,
    cfg: 7.0,
    batch_count: 4,
    batch_size: 1
  },

  saveImage: {
    filename_prefix: "batch_generation",
    output_path: "./output/batch"
  }
};
```

## Style and Aesthetic Control

### Artistic Styles

```javascript
// Style modifiers
const styleModifiers = {
  photography: "photorealistic, sharp focus, professional photography",
  painting: "oil painting, canvas texture, brush strokes",
  digital: "digital art, clean lines, vibrant colors",
  cinematic: "cinematic lighting, movie still, dramatic",
  minimalist: "minimalist, clean design, simple composition"
};
```

### Quality Enhancers

```javascript
// Quality improvement prompts
const qualityEnhancers = {
  technical: "highly detailed, sharp focus, professional",
  artistic: "masterpiece, best quality, award winning",
  lighting: "dramatic lighting, studio lighting, professional lighting",
  composition: "perfect composition, rule of thirds, balanced"
};
```

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Prompt Chaining

```javascript
// Multi-step prompt refinement
const promptChain = {
  step1: "basic concept",
  step2: "add style and mood",
  step3: "enhance technical quality",
  step4: "add specific details",
  step5: "optimize for model"
};

const chainedPrompt = `
A serene mountain lake at sunset,
peaceful atmosphere, tranquil mood,
highly detailed, masterpiece quality,
golden hour lighting, dramatic clouds,
sharp focus, professional photography,
intricate reflections, crystal clear water
`;
```

### Negative Prompt Optimization

```javascript
// Effective negative prompts
const negativePrompts = {
  general: "blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, poorly drawn, bad anatomy",
  realistic: "cartoon, anime, illustration, painting, drawing",
  artistic: "photorealistic, photograph, realistic, photo",
  technical: "artifacts, noise, grain, compression, jpeg, watermark"
};
```

## Workflow Optimization

### Efficient Generation Setup

```javascript
// Optimized workflow configuration
const optimizedWorkflow = {
  model: "Realistic_Vision_V5.1",
  prompt: "masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed",
  negative: "blurry, low quality, distorted",
  settings: {
    steps: 20,
    cfg: 7.0,
    sampler: "euler",
    scheduler: "normal",
    width: 1024,
    height: 1024
  },
  performance: {
    batch_size: 1,
    vae_tiling: true,
    attention_optimization: "xformers"
  }
};
```

### Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

```javascript
// Performance presets
const performancePresets = {
  draft: {
    steps: 10,
    cfg: 6.0,
    resolution: "512x512",
    useCase: "quick previews"
  },

  standard: {
    steps: 20,
    cfg: 7.0,
    resolution: "1024x1024",
    useCase: "most applications"
  },

  premium: {
    steps: 30,
    cfg: 8.0,
    resolution: "1536x1536",
    useCase: "professional work"
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting Generation Issues

### Common Problems

```javascript
// Issue diagnosis and solutions
const troubleshooting = {
  "blurry results": {
    cause: "Low step count or CFG too low",
    solution: "Increase steps to 20+, CFG to 7.0+"
  },

  "artifacts": {
    cause: "CFG too high or incompatible sampler",
    solution: "Reduce CFG to 8.0 or switch sampler"
  },

  "inconsistent style": {
    cause: "Weak or conflicting prompts",
    solution: "Strengthen style keywords, use weights"
  },

  "poor composition": {
    cause: "Missing composition guidance",
    solution: "Add composition keywords and aspect ratios"
  }
};
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Templates

```javascript
// Reusable prompt templates
const promptTemplates = {
  portrait: `
(masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed)
portrait of PERSON,
AGE years old, GENDER,
EMOTION expression,
HAIR_STYLE hair, EYE_COLOR eyes,
PROFESSIONAL_PHOTOGRAPHY,
sharp focus, professional lighting
--negative
blurry, low quality, deformed, ugly
  `,

  landscape: `
(masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed)
LOCATION landscape,
TIME_OF_DAY lighting,
WEATHER conditions,
MOOD atmosphere,
PROFESSIONAL_PHOTOGRAPHY,
sharp focus, depth of field
--negative
blurry, low quality, distorted
  `
};
```

### Iterative Refinement

```javascript
// Step-by-step improvement process
const refinementProcess = {
  step1: "Generate initial concept",
  step2: "Refine composition and lighting",
  step3: "Enhance details and quality",
  step4: "Adjust colors and mood",
  step5: "Final polish and optimization"
};
```
